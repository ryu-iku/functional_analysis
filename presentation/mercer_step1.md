The Arzel\u00e0-Ascoli Theorem is a fundamental result in real analysis and functional analysis that provides conditions under which a sequence of continuous functions on a compact set will have a uniformly convergent subsequence. It is a powerful tool for proving the existence of solutions to differential equations, properties of integral operators, and other results involving function spaces.\n\n### High-Level Intuition\n\nIn finite-dimensional Euclidean space, a set is \"compact\" (meaning every sequence in the set has a convergent subsequence) if and only if it is closed and bounded (Heine-Borel theorem). However, in infinite-dimensional spaces, such as spaces of functions, being closed and bounded is not enough to guarantee compactness. Functions can be bounded but still \"wiggle\" infinitely fast, preventing convergence.\n\nThe Arzel\u00e0-Ascoli Theorem provides the *additional conditions* needed for a set of functions to be relatively compact (meaning its closure is compact) in a space of continuous functions. These conditions essentially limit how \"wiggly\" or \"spread out\" the functions in the set can be.\n\n### Formal Statement (Simplified for Context)\n\nLet $X$ be a compact metric space (e.g., a closed and bounded interval like $[a,b]$ in $\\mathbb{R}$). Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a family (set) of continuous functions from $X$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ (or $\\mathbb{C}$, or $\\mathbb{R}^n$).\n\nThe Arzel\u00e0-Ascoli Theorem states that $\\mathcal{F}$ is **relatively compact** in the space of continuous functions $C(X)$ (equipped with the uniform norm, $\\|f\\|_\\infty = \\sup_{x \\in X} |f(x)|$) if and only if it satisfies two conditions:\n\n1.  **Pointwise Boundedness:** For each point $x \\in X$, the set of values $\\{f(x) : f \\in \\mathcal{F}\\}$ is bounded. That is, for every $x \\in X$, there exists a constant $M_x$ such that $|f(x)| \\le M_x$ for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n    *   *(Often, in practical applications, a stronger condition called **uniform boundedness** is used: there exists a single constant $M$ such that $|f(x)| \\le M$ for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and all $x \\in X$. For continuous functions on a compact domain, pointwise boundedness implies uniform boundedness.)*\n\n2.  **Equicontinuity:** The family $\\mathcal{F}$ is equicontinuous. This means that all functions in the family are \"equally continuous\" at every point. Formally, for every $\\epsilon > 0$ and every $x \\in X$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$ and all $x' \\in X$ with $d(x, x') < \\delta$, we have $|f(x) - f(x')| < \\epsilon$.\n    *   *(The key here is that $\\delta$ depends only on $\\epsilon$ and $x$, not on the individual function $f$. It ensures that no function in the family can vary too rapidly.)*\n\nIf these two conditions are met, then every sequence of functions in $\\mathcal{F}$ has a subsequence that converges uniformly to a continuous function.\n\n### Relevance to Mercer's Theorem (as per text)\n\nIn **Step 1 of the proof of Mercer's Theorem**, the Arzel\u00e0-Ascoli Theorem is invoked to establish that the Hilbert-Schmidt integral operator $T_k$ is a **compact operator**.\n\nThe statement in the text is: \"Therefore, according to the Arzel\u00e0-Ascoli theorem (Arzel\u00e0, 1895), the image of the unit ball after applying the operator is compact. In other words, the operator $T_k$ is compact.\"\n\nLet's break down how this connection works:\n\n1.  **The Operator $T_k$:**\n    $T_k f(x) := \\int_a^b k(x,y) f(y) \\, dy$ (Eq. 18).\n    This operator maps functions $f \\in L^2([a,b])$ to functions $T_k f \\in C([a,b])$ (the space of continuous functions on $[a,b]$), provided $k(x,y)$ is continuous.\n\n2.  **Compact Operator Definition:** A linear operator $A: V \\to W$ (between normed spaces) is called **compact** if it maps bounded sets in $V$ to relatively compact sets in $W$. In the context of Mercer's Theorem, $V = L^2([a,b])$ and $W = C([a,b])$. We want to show that the image of the unit ball in $L^2([a,b])$ (i.e., the set $\\{T_k f \\mid \\|f\\|_{L^2} \\le 1\\}$) is relatively compact in $C([a,b])$.\n\n3.  **Applying Arzel\u00e0-Ascoli:** To show that the set $\\mathcal{F} = \\{T_k f \\mid \\|f\\|_{L^2} \\le 1\\}$ is relatively compact in $C([a,b])$, we need to verify the two conditions of Arzel\u00e0-Ascoli:\n\n    *   **Uniform Boundedness:** We need to show that there is a constant $M$ such that for all $f$ with $\\|f\\|_{L^2} \\le 1$, and for all $x \\in [a,b]$, $|T_k f(x)| \\le M$.\n        *   $|T_k f(x)| = \\left| \\int_a^b k(x,y) f(y) \\, dy \\right|$\n        *   By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: $\\le \\left( \\int_a^b |k(x,y)|^2 \\, dy \\right)^{1/2} \\left( \\int_a^b |f(y)|^2 \\, dy \\right)^{1/2}$\n        *   Since $\\|f\\|_{L^2} \\le 1$, this becomes: $\\le \\left( \\int_a^b |k(x,y)|^2 \\, dy \\right)^{1/2} \\cdot 1$\n        *   The kernel $k(x,y)$ is assumed to be **continuous** on the compact set $[a,b] \\times [a,b]$, so it is bounded (Eq. 17: $\\sup_{x,y} k(x,y) < \\infty$). Let $K_{max} = \\sup_{x,y} |k(x,y)|$.\n        *   Then $\\int_a^b |k(x,y)|^2 \\, dy \\le \\int_a^b K_{max}^2 \\, dy = K_{max}^2 (b-a)$.\n        *   So, $|T_k f(x)| \\le K_{max} \\sqrt{b-a}$. This shows that the family $\\{T_k f\\}$ is uniformly bounded.\n\n    *   **Equicontinuity:** We need to show that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that for all $f$ with $\\|f\\|_{L^2} \\le 1$, and for any $x_1, x_2 \\in [a,b]$ with $|x_1 - x_2| < \\delta$, we have $|T_k f(x_1) - T_k f(x_2)| < \\epsilon$.\n        *   $|T_k f(x_1) - T_k f(x_2)| = \\left| \\int_a^b (k(x_1,y) - k(x_2,y)) f(y) \\, dy \\right|$\n        *   By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: $\\le \\left( \\int_a^b |k(x_1,y) - k(x_2,y)|^2 \\, dy \\right)^{1/2} \\left( \\int_a^b |f(y)|^2 \\, dy \\right)^{1/2}$\n        *   Again, since $\\|f\\|_{L^2} \\le 1$, this simplifies to: $\\le \\left( \\int_a^b |k(x_1,y) - k(x_2,y)|^2 \\, dy \\right)^{1/2}$\n        *   Since $k(x,y)$ is **continuous** on the compact set $[a,b] \\times [a,b]$, it is **uniformly continuous**. This means that for any $\\eta > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $|x_1 - x_2| < \\delta$, then $|k(x_1,y) - k(x_2,y)| < \\eta$ for *all* $y \\in [a,b]$.\n        *   So, if $|x_1 - x_2| < \\delta$, then $\\int_a^b |k(x_1,y) - k(x_2,y)|^2 \\, dy < \\int_a^b \\eta^2 \\, dy = \\eta^2 (b-a)$.\n        *   Thus, $|T_k f(x_1) - T_k f(x_2)| < \\eta \\sqrt{b-a}$. By choosing $\\eta$ appropriately (e.g., $\\eta = \\epsilon/\\sqrt{b-a}$), we can make this difference less than $\\epsilon$. Crucially, $\\delta$ depends only on $\\epsilon$ (and the uniform continuity of $k$), not on $f$. This demonstrates equicontinuity.\n\nSince both uniform boundedness and equicontinuity are satisfied, the Arzel\u00e0-Ascoli Theorem ensures that the image of the unit ball under $T_k$ is relatively compact in $C([a,b])$. This implies that $T_k$ is a compact operator. The compactness of $T_k$ is a critical prerequisite for applying the Spectral Theorem for compact self-adjoint operators in the next step of Mercer's proof.
